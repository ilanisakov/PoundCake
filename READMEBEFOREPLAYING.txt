Hey,

Welcome to my game.
It's called PoundCake.

Run it in 16:9

To play it you need to use Xbox controllers.
The wireless adapter is super finiky so be careful for that.
I recommend just plugging in the controllers via microUSB cord.

Before playing make sure that if you are using 2 controllers you use player 1 and player 2.
If you are using 3, make sure you are on player 1,2 and 3.

So yeah, sorry if it's difficult to get started.
